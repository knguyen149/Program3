The program is much more complicate than I anticipated so I ran out of time. In all honesty, maybe drawing a flow chart would have help out a great deal... Regardless, this program taught me a great deal. I wasted a lot of time trying to create objects using user input as the object names. Eventually, I gave up and resolved to creating objects with empty constructors and populate the objects using setter methods. I create a vector of these objects and only know how to access these objects using vector subcript. I am wondering if there is another way to access these objects. I also wasted a lot of time trying to use the concept of reposition, ie. using custID from Order object as custID for Customer object. It didn't work for some reason. It kept telling me that the class was undefined even though I include all the necessary #include. I didn't get a chance to figure out why outputReport is not working as inteded as well. I think if I had started earlier along with a flowchart, maybe I would have finished....
